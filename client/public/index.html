    <meta name="description" content="We are the Spartabots, a robotics club participating in the FIRST Robotics Competition as team 2976.

      Within our completely student built team, we use our problem solving, critical thinking and analytical skills to create a competitive robot within 6 weeks.
      
      The club was created in 2008 and initially worked in the garage of one of our mentors. In the first few years of the club we struggled, but always managed to bring a robot to competitions. During that time, our team never managed to advance to the elimination rounds of any competitions, but by 2014, the Spartabots had made it through two district competitions, getting second place in one of them, and qualified for regionals." />

      Notice the use of %PUBLIC_URL% in the tags above.
      It will be replaced with the URL of the `public` folder during the build.
      Only files inside the `public` folder can be referenced from the HTML.

      Unlike "/favicon.ico" or "favicon.ico", "%PUBLIC_URL%/favicon.ico" will
      work correctly both with client-side routing and a non-root public URL.
      Learn how to configure a non-root public URL by running `npm run build`.
